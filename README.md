# SQL and Tableau Showcase on current COVID-19 Data from Austria and Denmark

COVID data set taken from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

- SQL Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - CREATE/ALTER/DROP/NOT NULL/VIEW 
- SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT/WHERE/HAVING/GROUP BY/USE
